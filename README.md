Two survey datasets from different telescopes are used in our study. The first survey dataset HTRU 2 was obtained during an analysis of HTRU Medium Latitude data by Thornton (2013). The second dataset is LOTAAS 1, which was obtained from LOTAAS, the LOFAR Tied-Array All-sky Survey (Lofar Working Group 2013; Cooper 2014).  
The feature data were extracted from these datasets by the Pulsar Feature Lab on https: //doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1536472.v1.
